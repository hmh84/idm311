        <h1>Case Study for IDM 311</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Hunter Hampton</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>
            My 2022 Winter quarter at Drexel I took IDM 311 - UI Design for Immersive Media, a class to introduce us to
            and build interfaces in Unity.
        </p>

        <p>
            The goal of this final project was to create multiple user friendly UI and environment interactions in a 3D
            platform.
        </p>

        <h2>Process</h2>

        <p>
            Leading up to the project, we spent the first few weeks completing official Unity Learn tutorials covering
            the basics of the editor, developing environments, and scripting.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                I found an initial environment that was free and could be molded to fit the requirements.
            </li>

            <p class="indent">
                - For this I imported the scene and inspected the component hierarchy to see what could be manipulated
                such as the pond water.
            </p>

            <li>
                Ideated what UI and environment controls I would make
            </li>
            <li>
                Proposed the project to the acting client (our professor)
            </li>

            <h3>After approval…</h3>

            <li>
                <p class="group-title">Week 1:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Moved all the scene's objects into position for the interactions
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Setup boundaries using invisible plains to make sure the user cannot fall off
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Created initial interactions: When clicking the blue icon stone, the pond would drain or
                        fill. When clicking the mountains, they would all raise or fall. These both had Problem #1
                        listed below.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="group-title">Week 2:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Fixed Problem #1 & #2
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Added torch prefabs and the click interaction to toggle light emission
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Added background music
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Created settings menu UI with background music muting toggle
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="group-title">Week 3:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Fixed Problem #3
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Styled the settings menu
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Perfected the “Auto Rotate” and toggle functionality, even having the slider handle match the
                        sun's current position in the sky.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Problems</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                My very first problem I ran into immediately was changing a GameObject's transform property, if it's not
                in the top level of scene hierarchy, it will likely not move where you expect it to.
            </li>

            <p class="solution">
                The solution was researching why this would be happening on Unity's public forms. I discovered that a
                nested GameObject position is relative to the parent object, therefore you should use the localPosition
                property instead of the position property.
            </p>

            <li>
                Tracking Recast hits using hard coded object names was inefficient, this became problematic once I
                started re-naming objects, the recast hit would never be detected, failing silently because it didn't
                produce an error, Unity just thought the object I clicked didn't match the name I entered.
            </li>

            <p class="solution">
                The solution was to not hard code the GameObject names in the hit detection, but to use the the “name”
                property on the public variables.
            </p>

            <li>
                The basic Raycasting mouse click test passes through interfaces. This was a problem because one of the
                main environment interactions is clicking the mountains, which the settings menu is placed in front of,
                so a single click was both toggling checkboxes and raising/lowering the mountains.
            </li>

            <p class="solution">
                The solution was to limit the Raycast physics check to only listen for hits on a specific Unity layer, a
                new layer I made only for intractable objects.
            </p>
        </ol>

        <h2>Deliverables</h2>

        <ol>
            <p class="group-title">3 UI Controls:</p>

            <li>
                A “Auto Rotate” checkbox toggle to play and pause the sun's rotation.
            </li>

            <li>
                When the “Auto Rotate” checkbox is disabled, a range slider appears allowing manual adjustment of
                the
                sun's position in the sky to affect lighting conditions.
            </li>

            <li>
                Checkbox toggle to mute/un-mute background music.
            </li>

            <p class="group-title">3 GameObject interactions</p>

            <li>
                Clicking on the first blue icon stone will drain or fill the pond
            </li>

            <li>
                When the “Auto Rotate” checkbox is disabled, a range slider appears allowing manual adjustment of
                the
                sun's position in the sky to affect lighting conditions.
            </li>

            <li>
                Checkbox toggle to mute/un-mute background music.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Outcome & Reflection</h2>

        <ul>
            <p class="group-title">Learned:</p>
            <li>Use rigid body and mesh/box colliders</li>
            <li>Write Unity scrips and increase knowledge with using C# class based coding</li>
            <li>Accept keyboard and mouse input, including the use of Raycasting</li>
            <li>Manipulate gravity and velocity for movement and jumping</li>
            <li>Principals of interface design in a game environment</li>
            <li>Smooth object transforming</li>
            <li>Make basic materials</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            If I had more time I would have simply put more intractable features in like a skybox with stars and
            constellations and solved a bug with Raycasting where if the ray of your pointer passes through
            multiple clickable GameObjects from different scripts, it will trigger both. And how to organize
            scripts and game logic better, including how to run scripts that aren't attached to a game object as
            a component.
        </p>

        <p>
            Overall I am satisfied with what I was able to learn and accomplish in the given time, having no
            experience with Unity prior to this project.

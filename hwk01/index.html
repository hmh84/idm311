            <p>On the Oculus Quest 2 there's a game called VR-Chat, an online virtual world platform that allows users
                to interact with others with user-created 3D character models (aka Avatars) and worlds.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>Current Experience</h2>
            <p>A problem I found with this game, which you will see below, is the experience of selecting an avatar. The
                issue is that upon creating an account, the first thing user is given the option to explore are these
                "Avatar Worlds", which are game maps containing various player models for you to choose from.</p>
            <p>While at first this seems like a great way to introduce players to the game, I actually found it quite
                tedious, as you must endure walking through a large map of player models in a line to browse your
                options. It took me roughly 15 minutes to tour the entire map, and being a task and not the focus of the
                game itself, the experience of browsing by walking, turning, and rotating in a VR environment becomes
                nauseating for less-experienced players like myself.</p>
            <p>Here's an aerial view of an avatar map, the red dashed lines represent the paths the user must take to
                see all of the avatars.</p>

            <p>What the game DOES have is a menu for changing to your favorited avatars, however, no all-encompassing
                gallery.</p>

            <h3>Full Size: WebGL / Oculus VR (1920x1080)</h3>
            <p>The aim of this interface is to make changing avatars a quicker experience that isn't so physically
                straining on less experienced VR users.</p>
            <p>In my design, users could access the avatar changer from their user settings window. You would be able to
                search by name, as well as filter by category. Users can swipe through a 4x3 grid.</p>
